# Fall 2019 Source Lite Syllabus
 
## Description:
Source Lite is a **backend** and **frontend** web development program. You will learn how to program and write efficient Javascript code. You will apply your understanding of programming in Javascript to build functional web applications using **React**, **Firebase**, **HTML/CSS**, **Node.js** and **Ant Design**. We will be using **GitHub** throughout this course to handle version control, work flow, and code sharing. 
 
## Class Format:
We will meet twice a week:
* Lecture: Sundays 3:00-4:45pm in #9, Richardson
  * Introduce concepts
  * Apply concepts to assignments and projects
* Check ins: 
  * Where? In #9, Launchpad
  * When? Tuesday 5:15 - 6:15pm, Wednesday 2:15 - 3:15pm, Friday 2:30 - 3:30pm
  * Must attend at least 1 per week
  * Reinforce skills and build projects
  * Check up on progress
  * Ask questions
 
## Class Schedule:

**Week 1. Intro to Coding**  
  * Objectives: 
    * Understand what computer science, software engineering, and web development is all about. 
    * Introduce Javascript data types, operators, and functions. 
  * Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15qEVbfi7_SDkN6HLc-SGOIbmm1lSsOhNNJ88kutPxwE/edit?usp=sharing
  * Project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8TE_KksJFE_UnWBGRoMjpKzTdcCi7YpymosWzRaMWw/edit
  * Additional resources:
    * Codecademy, a FREE online programming tutorial service. If you want more practice understanding the concepts taught this week and implementing them, try sections 1 and 3. If you want to get a jump start on material we will cover next week, check out section 2 as well. https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
    * Crash Course Computer Science, Programming Basics: Statements & Functions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l26oaHV7D40 . Some material, specificially conditional statements and loops, mentioned in this video will be addressed in the next 2 weeks. This video covers both what we learned this week and what we will soon learn, so it will refresh your memory on some concepts and introduce you to others. Feel free to skip anything mentioning conditionals or for loops if it confuses you right now. In general, this video should help familiarize you with these basic programming concepts.
