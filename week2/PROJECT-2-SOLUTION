/*
Here we will declare our function. It has 3 parameters. One represents the total bill cost. The next represents the quality of service
the waiter or waitress provided. The final parameter represents the number of people who are splitting the bill.

While the parameter names are similar to those of the variables we just created, note that they are NOT the same.
Parameters are different from variables. Like variables, parameters can be named whatever you choose. It is helpful to call them something
that represents the kind of value you intend to pass to the function. This increased readability is useful to us and others when 
looking back at the code we have written.

To clarify the difference in parameters and variables:
Parameters - placeholders for values you will pass to the function at the time you call it. You can pass either actual values or variables to functions.

Variables - a name we define that holds a specific value

  the following conditional statements will run and when one of them is true or the else statement runs, the value for percentage
  will be set. The purpose of our percentage variable is that it will be determined by the quality of service provided and then
  used in our tip calculation. */
